# Self Introduction

My name is Faustina Okafor.
I hold a Bachelor degree from Ebonyi State University Abakalki.
Its an institution for higher learning in Nigeria.
I am an aspiring software Engineer and I am currently undergoing a very comprehensive and intensive 12 months training with Africa Leadership Accelarator.
I love to do hard things and I never stop trying until I succeed,
no matter how many times I fail.

## My three top skills are;
- Hardworking
- Creative
- Willing

I am hardworking because I juggled and excelled between school,
work and Church activities all at the same time.
So,
I can work under pressure and still deliver quality.
I am creative because as someone from a non luxurious background,
I always try to be innovative and come up with ideas that will help me achieve certain milestones in my career.
I am willing,
because I still don't know everything.
I am awork in progress and I'm always willing and open to learn new things that will help me advance in my career.
